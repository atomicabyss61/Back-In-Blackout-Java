# Back-In-Blackout Java Assignment

### Summary
The "Back in Blackout" assignment involves creating a simulation where devices attempt to connect to satellites orbiting a ring around Jupiter. It includes implementing world state changes, device activations, and specialized devices, with a focus on object-oriented design, utilization of Java libraries and JSON, and understanding of GPS technology's role in modern and futuristic settings. The assignment emphasizes design, testing, and systematic object-oriented programming practices.

### OOP Principles
* Encapsulation: By keeping satellite and device properties and behaviors within their respective classes, the code ensures that the internal state of an object is shielded from outside modification directly, promoting safer and more predictable behavior.

* Inheritance: Utilizing abstract classes allows for a hierarchical organization of common properties and behaviors, making it easier to manage and extend the codebase. This reduces redundancy and increases code reuse.

* Polymorphism: Implementing methods that behave differently based on the calling object allows for more flexible and dynamic code. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms, simplifying code management and extension.

* Abstraction: Defining a general framework with abstract classes and interfaces without specifying concrete implementations enables focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. This separation of concerns simplifies complexity and enhances modularity.

### Testing And Performance
In my project, I designed comprehensive tests to ensure robustness and reliability, achieving over 85% coverage. This extensive coverage demonstrates my commitment to quality and my ability to anticipate a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases. Through meticulous testing, I've ensured that the system behaves as expected under various conditions, significantly reducing the likelihood of bugs and enhancing the system's overall stability and performance.
